# ui-element-project-citybikes

## Purpose
This ui element receives information from the "CityBikes" bike sharing network. 
It accounts for bikeshare services and companies around the world, and lays out their information
in a clean database. In this instance, we are using solely data for Washington, DC's bikeshare 
service, Capitol BikeShare, run by Motivate Inc. 

## UI
The user will search for a street in the DMV area to search for bikeshare station intersections on that street. 
The user can then select one and see information about that particular station.
